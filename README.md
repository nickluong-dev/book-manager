# book-manager
A simple book manager that takes information from a plaintext file and organizes, searches, and updates books on a virtual shelf.

The program runs in the terminal and asks the user what they would like to do (Search, move, quit).

Searching will query through partial keyword searches. Each book is designated to a shelf/place and can be moved. If the user selects Quit, the plaintext file will be updated with any changes made to the shelf/place.
